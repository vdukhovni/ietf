<t>
This memo provides operational guidance to server operators to help
ensure that clients will be able to authenticate a server's certificate
chain via its published TLSA records.  Guidance is also provided to clients
to choose combinations of TLSA record parameters that are sufficiently
reliable to be usable for server authentication.  Finally, guidance is
given to protocol designers who wish to make use of TLSA records when
using them to secure protocols using a TLS and TLSA combination. 
</t>

<section title="Introduction">

<t>
The Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) add data origin
authentication and data integrity to the Domain Name System.  DNSSEC
is defined in <xref target="RFC4033"/>, <xref target="RFC4034"/> and
<xref target="RFC4035"/>.
</t>

<t>
In the context of this memo channel security is assumed to be provided
by TLS or DTLS.  The Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Datagram
Transport Layer Security (DTLS) protocols provide communications
privacy over the Internet.  By convention, TLS will be used through
this document and unless otherwise specified, the text applies equally
as well to the DTLS protocol.  Used without authentication, TLS
provides protection only against eavesdropping.  With authentication,
TLS also provides protection against man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.
Since the publication of the TLS 1.0 specification in <xref
target="RFC2246"/>, two updates to the protocol have been published:
TLS 1.1 <xref target="RFC4346"/> and TLS 1.2 <xref target="RFC5246"/>.
The DTLS protocol was later documented in <xref target="RFC6347"/>.
</t>

<t>
As described in the introduction of <xref target="RFC6698"/>, TLS
authentication via the existing public CA PKI suffers from an
over-abundance of trusted certificate authorities capable of issuing
certificates for any domain of their choice.  DNS-Based Authentication
of Named Entities (DANE) leverages the DNSSEC infrastructure to
publish trusted keys and certificates for use with TLS via a new
TLSA record type.  DNSSEC validated DANE TLSA records
yield a new PKI designed to augment or replace the trust model of
the existing public CA PKI.
</t>

<t>
When a client goes to the trouble of authenticating a certificate
presented by a TLS server, it should not continue to use the server in
case of authentication failure or else authentication serves no
purpose.  Consequently, if a client cannot reliably authenticate
correctly configured legitimate servers via a particular combination
of TLSA parameters, then the client SHOULD treat that combination of
parameters as unusable. <!-- XXXWJH: you don't say what to do if unusable;
the next sentence implies "connect anyway", which based on our
discussions of Type 0, is what I suspect you believe.  But I'd argue
it's very protocol dependent, and I don' think the average person will
say "if too much is broken out there, just give up on security" -->
Otherwise, the client risks routinely dropping connections to
legitimate servers.  Servers publishing TLSA records MUST be
configured in a manner that allows correctly configured clients to
successfully authenticate the server's TLS certificate.

    The "Server Name Indication", or SNI, describes the process by
    which a TLS client requests to connect to a particular service

    extension, a TLS server has no choice but to offer a PKIX
    certificate with a default server name.  Servers that are expected
    to host services for many clients need to present the correct
    certificate for the correct client, and the SNI extension provides
    a hint to the server which certificate should be transmitted to
    the client.

<section title="DANE TLSA record overview">
<!-- XXXWJH: This section is probably a bit long; we should just refer
the reader to 6698 generally and don't necessarily need such a long
overview.  That being said, I also find it useful.  I keep changing my
mind over the years how much repeating is a good thing between RFCs. -->
<t>
<xref target="RFC6698"/> specifies a protocol for publishing TLS server
certificate associations via DNSSEC.  The DANE TLSA specification defines
multiple TLSA RR types via combinations of the following 3 parameters:  </t>

<t>
<list style='symbols'>

<t>
The certificate usage field.  Section 2.1.1 of <xref target="RFC6698"/>
specifies 4 values ranging from 0 to 3.
</t>

<t>
The selector field.  Section 2.1.2 of <xref target="RFC6698"/>
specifies 2 values ranging from 0 to 1.
</t>

<t>
The matching type field.  Section 2.1.3 of <xref target="RFC6698"/>
specifies 3 values ranging from 0 to 2.
</t>

</list>
</t>

<t>
We may consider the certificate usage values 0 through 3 to be a
combination of two one-bit flags.  The low-bit chooses between
trust-anchor (TA) and end-entity (EE) certificates.  The high bit
chooses between public PKI issued and domain-issued certificates:
</t>

<t>
<list style="symbols">

<t>
When the low bit is set (certificate usages 1 and 3) the TLSA record
matches an EE (server) certificate.
</t>

<t>
When the low bit is not set (certificate usages 0 and 2) the TLSA
record matches a trust-anchor (a certificate authority) that issued
a certificate somewhere in the certificate chain the authenticates the
final end-entity certificate.
</t>

<t>
When the high bit is set (certificate usages 2 and 3) the server
certificate chain is domain-issued and may be verified without
reference to the existing public certificate authority PKI.  Trust is
entirely placed on the content of the TLSA records obtained via
DNSSEC.
</t>

<t>
When the high bit is not set (certificate usages 0 and 1) the TLSA
record publishes a server policy stating that its certificate
chain must pass PKIX validation <xref target="RFC5280"/>, with the
DANE TLSA record used to constrain the server certificate chain to
contain a given CA or EE certificate.
</t>

</list>
</t>

<t>
The selector field specifies whether the TLSA RR matches the whole
certificate or just its subjectPublicKeyInfo (i.e. an ASN.1 DER
encoding of the certificate's algorithm id, any parameters and the
public key data).  A selector field of
"0" specifies the whole certificate.  A selector field of "1"
specifies just the public key.  </t>

<t>
The matching type field specifies how the TLSA RR Certificate
Association Data field is to be compared with the certificate or
public key.  A value of "0" means exact match, the DER encoding of the
certificate or public is given in the TLSA RR.  A "1" value means a
SHA-256 digest and "2" means a SHA-512 digest.  Of these, only SHA-256
is mandatory to implement.  Clients SHOULD implement SHA-512, but
servers SHOULD NOT exclusively publish SHA-512 digests.  More
strongly, unless a "second preimage" attack is found against SHA-256,
servers should only publish SHA-256 digests.
</t>

<section title="Example TLSA record">
<t>
In the example TLSA record below:
</t>

<figure>
<artwork>
_25._tcp.mail.example.com. IN TLSA 3 1 2 (
                              E8B54E0B4BAA815B06D3462D65FBC7C0
                              CF556ECCF9F5303EBFBB77D022F834C0
                              5DC75F17F9963DF8A572A5B9209CF1AB
                              9DC14CD0C0C8393072D49365017553F8 )
</artwork>
</figure>

<t>
The certificate usage is "3", the selector is "1" and the matching type
is "2".  The rest of the record is the certificate association data field,
which is in this case the SHA-512 digest of the server public key.
</t>

</section><!-- DANE TLSA record overview -->

<section title="General DANE Guidelines">
  <t>These guidelines provide guidance for using or designing
  protocols for DANE, regardless of what type the TLSA record will
  actually contain.</t>
  <section title="DANE DNS Record Size Guidelines">
    <t>
      Selecting a combination of TLSA parameters to use requires
      careful thought.  One important consideration that must be
      accounted for is the size of the resulting TLSA record based on
      the parameters chosen.
    </t>
    <section title="UDP and TCP Considerations">

      <t>
	Deployments SHOULD avoid TLSA record sizes that cause UDP
	fragmentation within the networks to be used.
      </t>
      <t>
	Although TCP is a viable
	alternative technologically and would provide the ability to
	transfer larger DNS records between clients and servers, it is
	not yet widely deployed or permitted through many firewalls.
	TCP must be expected to be deployed on all the DNS servers and
	DNS clients for it to be a truly viable large-record solution.
      </t>
    </section>
    <section title= "Packet Size Considerations for TLSA Parameters">
      <t>
	Server operators SHOULD NOT generally publish "TLSA * 0 0"
	records, as even a single certificate is generally too large
	to be reliably delivered via DNS without TCP being widely
	available.  Furthermore, two full certificates may need to be
	published in the TLSA RRset for certificate rollover.
      </t>

      <t>
	While "TLSA * 1 0" records, which publish full public keys
	without the full X.509 wrapping, are generally more compact,
	these too should be used with caution.  For example, two
	2048-bit RSA keys require more than 512 bytes of DNS data even
	without the accompanying RRSIG records, and thus don't fit
	into a 512-byte DNS packet, and many firewalls today still
	drop DNS packets greater than 512 bytes in size.  Servers
	SHOULD publish the certificate or key digests within TLSA
	records instead.  The complete certificate should be
	transmitted to the client in band during the TLS handshake.
      </t>
    </section>
  </section>
  <section title="Selector Matching Guidelines">
  </section>
  <section title="Certificate Naming Check Conventions">
    <t>
      Certificates presented by a TLS server will contain either a
      Common Name (CN) or subjectAltName (or both), according to <xref
      target="RFC5280" />.  The server's hostname should be published
      within these fields, ideally within the subjectAltName.  This
      section discusses what must be done to match an expected name
      against the name found within a certificate, if required.
    </t>
    <t>
      The TLSA publisher for TLSA records for a given service MUST
      ensure that at least one of these TLSA records will match the
      server's certificate chain.  If SNI is not employed for a TLS
      connection, the TLSA record must match the server's default
      certificate.  If the SNI extension is sent by the client with a
      host_name (see <xref target="RFC3546"/> Section 3.1), the TLSA
      record must match the certificate presented by the server for
      that host_name.
    </t>

    <t>
      When, for example, the TLSA RRset is published at
    </t>
    <figure>
      <artwork>
        _25._tcp.mail.example.com
      </artwork>
    </figure>
    <t>
      the TLSA base domain is mail.example.com.  At least one of the
      TLSA records in the _25._tcp.mail.example.com RRset MUST match
      the server certificate chain, provided the client TLS hanshake
      included the SNI extension with a host_name of "mail.example.com".
    </t>

    <t>
      <!-- XXXWJH: this contradicts what the -smtp draft says -->
      <!-- XXXWJH: fixme based on discussions with Viktor -->
      Note: when the TLSA RRset query domain (base domain plus port and protocol
      prefixes) resolves to a DNSSEC validated CNAME pointing to a DNSSEC
      signed zone with the actual TLSA records, the content of the TLSA
      RRset will be retrieved from the target zone.  This has no effect on
      the value of the base domain, which remains the original domain to
      which the client prefixed the port and protocol.
    </t>

    <t>
      Note: Except with certificate usage "3", where name checks are not
      applicable (see Section <xref target="type3" />), DANE aware clients
      SHOULD use the base domain of the TLSA RRset to verify that the client
      has reached the correct server by checking that the TLSA base domain
      is matched by one of the subjectAltName (<xref target="RFC5280"/>) in
      the server certificate.  The commonName from the certificate subject
      DN MAY be used only when no subject alternative names are present.
      Additional acceptable names may be specified by protocol specific DANE
      RFCs.  For example, with SMTP both the destination domain name and the
      MX host name are acceptable in the server certificate.
    </t>

    <t>
      Since the server's ability to respond with the right certificate chain
      may be predicated on the TLS client providing the correct SNI
      information, DANE PKI aware clients SHOULD send the SNI extension with
      a host_name value of the base domain of the TLSA RRset (otherwise they
      risk failure to authenticate the server).  The server MUST support at
      least TLS 1.0 and SHOULD support TLS 1.2.
    </t>

    <t>
      Complications arise when TLSA records for a service are created by
      someone other than the server operator.  In this situation the
      server operator and TLSA record creator must cooperate to ensure
      that TLSA records don't fall out of step with the server certificate
      configuration.
    </t>

    <t>
      When the server operator is an MX Provider, ideally the application
      protocol allows the hosted customer to direct clients to the hosting
      provider's servers.  This way, the associated TLSA records will be
      found in the MX Provider's DNSSEC zone, thus avoiding the
      complexity of bilateral coordination of server certificate configuration
      and TLSA record management.
    </t>

    <t>
      For example, with SMTP, the customer's MX records can be pointed
      at the MX Provider's MX hosts.  When the customer's DNS zone is signed,
      the hostnames in that domain's MX records can be securely used as
      the base names for TLSA records managed by the MX Provider.
    </t>

  </section>
  <section title="TLSA Base Domain and CNAMEs">
    <t>
      When the protocol does not support service location indirection via
      MX, SRV or similar DNS records, the service may be redirected via
      a CNAME.  A CNAME is a more blunt instrument for this purpose, since
      unlike an MX or SRV record it remaps the origin domain to the target
      domain for all protocols.  Also Unlike MX or SRV records CNAME records
      may chain (though clients will generally impose implementation
      dependent maximum nesting depths).
    </t>

    <t>
      When CNAMEs are employed the best place to seek DANE TLSA records
      is in the MX Provider's domain, as the MX Provider best knows which
      certificates are deployed on the server.  Therefore, DANE PKI clients
      connecting to a server whose DNS name is a CNAME alias SHOULD
      generally follow the CNAME hop-by-hop to its ultimate target host
      (noting at each step whether the CNAME is DNSSEC validated) and use
      the resulting target host as the base domain for TLSA lookups.
      Standards for DANE TLS for each application protocol are expected
      to specify where to locate TLSA RRs when the destination is referred
      to by a CNAME.
    </t>

    <t>
      If CNAMEs were not followed, to support DANE validation the hosted
      domain would have to publish TLSA records that match the MX Provider
      certificate chain.  Since the hosted domain may not administer
      the MX Provider's server, this imposes a difficult key management burden
      on the MX Provider and hosted customer even with SNI.
    </t>

    <t>
      Accordingly, TLSA records SHOULD NOT be published for a base domain
      that is a CNAME.  Such TLSA records are not operationally robust,
      and SHOULD NOT be used by clients.
      <!-- XXXWJH: change to "only if you must" and warn about
	   synchronization, down time issues and monitoring requirements -->
    </t>

    <t>
      It may be tempting to publish CNAMEs in the hosted domain pointing
      to the MX Provider's TLSA RRset.  This only works when the MX Provider's
      TLSA RRs specify certificate usage 3.  Otherwise, a client that
      used the alias name (from the hosted rather than the MX Provider's
      domain) as the base domain to obtain the TLSA RRset would look for
      the hosted domain in the server certificate when performing name
      checks, and would generally fail to authenticate the server except
      in the rare cases when the server's certificate does include the
      hosted domain.
    </t>

    </figure>

    <t>
      <!-- XXXWJH: genericize to new section -->
      Though CNAMEs are illegal on the right hand side of MX and SRV
      records, they are supported by some implementations.  In that case,
      if the MX or SRV host is a CNAME alias the client SHOULD "chase" the
      CNAME and SHOULD use the target hostname as the base domain for
      TLSA records as well as the host_name in SNI.
    </t>
  </section>
  <section title="Interaction with Certificate Transparency">
    <t>
      <xref target="RFC6962"/> Certificate Transparency or CT for short,
      defines an approach to mitigate the risk of rogue or compromised
      public CAs issuing unauthorized certificates.  In this section we
      clarify the interaction of CT and DANE.  We observe that CT applies
      only to public CAs, and only when they are free to issue unauthorized
      certificates for a domain.  If the CA is not a public CA, or DANE
      TLSA RRs constrain the end-entity certificate to a fixed public
      key, there is no role for CT, and clients SHOULD NOT apply CT checks.
    </t>

    <t>
      When a server is authenticated via a DANE TLSA RR with certificate
      usage "1" or "3" (that is an end-entity certificate association),
      the domain owner has unambiguously specified the certificate
      associated with the given service.  Even if a rogue CA were able
      to issue an unauthorized end-entity certificate that binds a public
      key to a name in that domain, barring "second preimage" attacks on
      SHA-256 or SHA-512 any such certificate would not match the TLSA
      record and would be rejected.
    </t>

    <t>
      Therefore, when a TLS client authenticates the TLS server via a
      TLSA certificate association with usage "1" or "3", CT checks SHOULD
      NOT be performed.  Publication of the server certificate or public
      key (digest) in a DNSSEC signed zone by the domain owner assures
      the client that the certificate is not an unauthorized certificate
      issued by a rogue CA without the domain owner's consent.
    </t>

    <t>
      When a server is authenticated via a DANE TLSA RR with certificate
      usage "2" and the server certificate does not chain to a known
      public root CA, CT cannot apply (CT logs only accept chains that
      start with a known root).  Since certificate usage "2" is generally
      intended to support non-PKIX trust anchors, by far the simplest client
      implementation strategy is not perform CT checks with usage "2".
      A server operator that wants CT checks can publish TLSA RRs with
      usage "0", or can obviate them with usage "1" or "3".  It is therefore
      recommended that clients SHOULD NOT perform CT checks with usage "2".
    </t>

    <t>
      CT checks are applicable with certificate usage "0" when the client
      supports both DANE and CT and the trusted PKIX root issuer is a known
      public root.
    </t>
  </section>
  <section title="Design Considerations for Protocols Using DANE">
    <section title="Design Considerations for non-PKIX Protocols">
      <t>
	For some application protocols the existing public CA PKI is
	not viable.  For these (non-PKIX) protocols servers SHOULD NOT
	suggest publishing TLSA records with certificate usage "0" or
	"1", as clients cannot be expected to perform <xref
	target="RFC5280"/> PKIX validation or <xref target="RFC6125"/>
	identity verification.
      </t>

      <t>
	<!-- XXXWJH: security vs robustness -->
	Clients using non-PKIX protocols MAY choose to treat any TLSA records
	with certificate usage "0" or "1" as unusable.  They may then choose to
	connect via unauthenticated mandatory TLS if no alternative
	authentication mechanisms are available.
      </t>

      <t>
	If despite this recommendation servers for non-PKIX protocols do
	publish TLSA records with certificate usage "0" or "1", clients
	should make use of these to the fullest extent possible.
      </t>

      <section title="Certificate usage 1">

	<t>
	  With certificate usage "1" such clients SHOULD ignore the PKIX
	  validation requirement, and authenticate the server per the content

  <section title="TLSA records and trust anchor digests">
    <t>
      With TLSA records that match the EE certificate, the TLS client has
      no difficulty matching the TLS record against the server certificate,
      as this certificate is always present in the TLS server certificate
      chain.  The TLS client can, if necessary, extract the public key from
      the server certificate, and can if necessary compute the appropriate
      digest.
    </t>

    <t>
      With DANE TLSA records that match the digest of TA certificate or
      public key, a complication arises when the TA certificate is omitted
      from the server's certificate chain.  This can happen when the
      trust-anchor is a root certificate authority, as stated in section
      7.4.2 of <xref target="RFC2246"/>:
      <!-- XXXWJH: old reference; need to reference current TLS docs instead -->
      <!-- either 4346 or 5246 -->
    </t>

    <figure>
      <artwork>
	The sender's certificate must come first in the list.
	Each following certificate must directly certify the one
	preceding it.  Because certificate validation requires
	that root keys be distributed independently, the
	self-signed certificate which specifies the root
	certificate authority may optionally be omitted from the
	chain, under the assumption that the remote end must
	already possess it in order to validate it in any case.
      </artwork>
    </figure>

    <t>
      This means that TLSA records that match a TA certificate or public
      key digest are not directly sufficient to validate the peer certificate
      chain.  If no matching certificate is found in the server's certificate
      chain, the chain may be signed by an omitted root CA whose digest
      matches the TLSA record.  We will consider each trust-anchor
      certificate usage in turn.
    </t>

    <section anchor="d0" title="Trust anchor digests with certificate usage 0">

      <t>
	In this case, from the server's perspective, the omission of the root
	CA seems reasonable, since in addition to authentication via DANE
	TLSA records the client is expected to perform <xref target="RFC5280"/>
	PKIX validation of the server's trust chain and thus to already
	have a copy of the omitted root certificate.
      </t>

      <t>
	From the client's perspective the situation is more nuanced.  Despite
	the server's indicated preference for PKIX validation the client
	may not posess (or may not fully trust) a complete set of public
	root CAs.  This is especially likely in protocols where the existing
	public CA PKI is not applicable.  If it is likely that a client
	lacks a sufficiently complete list of trusted CAs, and that a
	non-negligible number of servers publish certificate usage 0 TLSA
	records with digests of omitted root CAs, then such a client SHOULD
	treat such TLSA records as "unusable".  Simply ignoring PKIX
	validation is not an option, since the client will also be unable
	to match the TLSA record.  The client will then typically fall back
	to unauthenticated TLS, as by assumption PKIX is also not an option
	(see <xref target="I-D.ietf-dane-srv"/>).
      </t>

    </section><!-- Trust anchor digests with certificate usage 0 -->

    <section title="Trust anchor digests with certificate usage 2">

      <t>
	Here there is no expectation that the client is pre-configured with
	the trust anchor certificate.  With certificate usage "2" clients rely
	on the TLSA records alone, but with a matching type other than "0"
	the TLSA records contain neither the full trust anchor certificate
	nor the full public key.  If the server's certificate chain does
	not contain the trust-anchor certificate, most clients will be
	unable to authenticate the server.
      </t>

      <t>
	Therefore, whoever creates TLSA records with certificate usage "2"
	and a non-zero matching type MUST ensure that the corresponding
	server is configured to include the associated trust anchor certificate
	in its TLS handshake certificate chain even if that certificate is
	a self-signed root CA and would have been optional in the context
	of the existing public CA PKI.
      </t>

      <t>
	Since servers are expected to always provide usage "2" trust
	anchor certificates (either via DNS or else via the TLS hanshake),
	clients SHOULD fully support this certificate usage.  Clients MAY
	choose to treat it as unusable if experience proves that servers
	don't consistently live up to their obligations.

  <section title="Trust anchor public keys">

    <t>
      TLSA records with certificate usage "0" or "2", selector "1" and a
      matching type of "0" publish the full public key of a trust anchor
      via DNS.  In section 6.1.1 of <xref target="RFC5280"/> the
      definition of a trust anchor consists of the following four parts:
    </t>

    <t><list style="numbers">
      <t>the trusted issuer name,</t>
      <t>the trusted public key algorithm,</t>
      <t>the trusted public key, and</t>
      <t>optionally, the trusted public key parameters associated with the public key.</t>
    </list></t>

    <t>
      Items 2&ndash;4 are precisely the contents of the subjectPublicKeyInfo
      published in the TLSA record, but the issuer name is not included
      in the public key.
    </t>

    <t>
      With certificate usage "0" when the client is able to perform PKIX
      validation, the client can construct a complete PKIX trust chain
      and thus has access to the trust anchor name.  So in that case the
      client can verify that the server certificate chain is issued by a
      trust anchor that matches the TLSA record.
    </t>

    <t>
      With certificate usage "2" or with certificate usage "0" for a
      non-PKIX protocol, the client may not have the missing trust anchor
      certificate, and cannot generally verify whether a particular
      certificate chain is "issued by" the trust anchor described in the
      TLSA record.  If the server certificate chain includes a CA certificate
      whose public key matches the TLSA record, the client can match that
      CA as the intended issuer.  Otherwise, the client can only check
      that the topmost certificate in the server's chain is "signed by"
      by the trust anchor public key in the TLSA record.
    </t>

    <t>
      Since trust chain validation via bare public keys rather than trusted
      CA certificates may be difficult to implement in existing TLS
      applications, servers MUST include the trust anchor certificate in
      their certificate chain when the certificate usage is "2".  With
      non-PKIX protocols servers SHOULD avoid publishing TLSA records
      with certificate usage "0", but if they do, they SHOULD include any
      trust anchor certificates in the TLS certificate chain.
    </t>

    <t>
      If none of the server's certificate chain elements match a public
      key specified in full in a TLSA record, clients SHOULD attempt to
      check whether the topmost certificate in the chain is signed by the
      provided public key, and if so consider the server trust chain valid,
      with authentication complete if name checks are also successful.

      TLSA certificate usage "0" allows a domain to publish constraints
      on the set of certificate authorities trusted to issue certificates
      for its TLS servers.  It is expected that clients will only accept
      trust chains which contain a match for one of the published TLSA
      records.  This is simple for TLSA certificate usage "1" where the
      PKIX trust chain always contains the leaf server certificate.
      The situation for certificate usage "0" is more subtle.
    </t>

    <t>
      It may often be the case the server domain publishes trust in a
      particular public root CA, expecting that clients will then only
      accept chains anchored at that root.  It is however possible that
      the client's set of trusted certificates includes some intermediate
      CAs, either with or without the corresponding root CA.  When a
      client construct a trust chain leading from a trusted intermediate
      CA to the server leaf certificate, such a chain may omit any trusted
      roots published in the server's TLSA records.
    </t>

    <t>
      If the omitted root is also trusted, the client may erroneously reject
      the server chain, if it fails to determine that the shorter chain it
      constructed extends to a longer trusted chain that matches the TLSA
      records.  This means that a client SHOULD not always stop extending
      the chain when the first locally trusted certificate is found.  If
      no TLSA records have matched any of the elements of the chain, it
      MUST build attempt to build a longer chain if the trusted certificate
      found is not self-issued, in the hope that a certificate closer to
      the root may in fact match the server's TLSA records.

<section title="Note on DNSSEC security">

<t>
Clearly the security of the DANE TLSA PKI rests on the security of
the underlying DNSSEC infrastructure.  While this memo is not a guide
to DNSSEC security a few comments may be helpful to TLSA implementors.
</t>

<t>
With the existing public CA PKI, name constraints are rarely used, and
public root CAs can issue certificates for any domain of its choice.
With DNSSEC the situation is different. Only the registrar of record
can update a domain's DS record in the registry parent zone, in some
cases of course the registry is the sole registrar.  With gTLDs for
which multiple registrars compete to provide domains in a single registry
it is important to make sure that rogue registrars cannot easily initiate
an unauthorized domain transfer, and thus take over DNSSEC for the domain.
A registrar lock on one's domain may be a reasonable precaution for this
reason.
</t>

<t>
When the registrar is also the DNS operator for the domain, when using
DNSSEC one needs to consider whether the registrar will allow orderly
migration of the domain to another registrar or DNS operator in a way
that will maintain DNSSEC integrity.  Discuss this with your registrar
DNS operator before it is an emergency.
</t>

<t>
DNSSEC signed RRsets cannot be securely revoked before they expire.
Plan accordingly and don't generate signatures with excessively
long duration.  For domains publishing high-value keys, a signature
lifetime of a few days is reasonable, with the zone resigned every
day or so.  For more mundane domains a good signature lifetime is
a couple of weeks to a month, with the zone resigned every week or
so.  Monitoring of the signature lifetime is important.  If the
zone is not resigned in a timely manner, one risks a major outage
with the entire domain becoming invalid.

<section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">

<t>
Application protocols that cannot make use of the existing public
CA PKI (so called non-PKIX protocols), may choose to not implement
certain PKIX-dependent TLSA record types defined in <xref
target="RFC6698"/>, or may choose to make a best-effort use of such
records.  In neither case is security compromised, since by assumption
PKIX verification is simply not an option for these protocols.  When
the TLS server is authenticated based on the TLSA records alone,
the client is as well authenticated as possible, treating the TLSA
records as unusable would lead to weaker security.
</t>

<t>
Therefore, when TLSA records are used with protocols where PKIX does not
apply, the recommended trade-off is for servers to not publish
PKIX-dependent TLSA records, and for clients to use them as best they can,
but otherwise treat them unusable.  Of course when PKIX validation is an
option clients SHOULD perform PKIX validation per <xref target="RFC6698"/>.
