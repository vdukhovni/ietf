  <h1 id="rfc.section.1"><a href="#rfc.section.1">1.</a> Introduction</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.1">There has historically been no scalable way for SMTP server operators to deploy certificates with a client-trusted subject name.  It is only with the deployment of DNSSEC and DANE that authenticated TLS for SMTP to MX becomes possible between parties that have not already established an identity convention out-of-band.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.1.1"><a href="#rfc.section.1.1">1.1.</a> Background</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.1.1.p.1">The Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) add data origin authentication and data integrity to the Domain Name System.  DNSSEC is defined in <a href="#RFC4033">[RFC4033]</a>, <a href="#RFC4034">[RFC4034]</a> and <a href="#RFC4035">[RFC4035]</a>.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.1.p.2">As described in the introduction of DNS-Based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE) <a href="#RFC6698">[RFC6698]</a>, TLS authentication via the existing public Certificate Authority (CA) Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) suffers from an over-abundance of trusted certificate authorities capable of issuing certificates for any domain of their choice.  DANE leverages the DNSSEC infrastructure to publish trusted keys and certificates for use with TLS via a new "TLSA" DNS record type.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.1.p.3">The Transport Layer Security (TLS <a href="#RFC5246">[RFC5246]</a>) protocol enables secure TCP communication.  In the context of this memo, channel security is assumed to be provided by TLS.  Used without authentication, TLS protects only against eavesdropping.  With authentication, TLS also protects against man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.1.2"><a href="#rfc.section.1.2">1.2.</a> <a href="#channelsec" id="channelsec">SMTP Channel Security</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.1.2.p.1">The Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP <a href="#RFC5321">[RFC5321]</a>) is a multi-hop store &amp; forward protocol, while TLS security protects traffic on a hop-by-hop basis.  The number of hops from the sender's Message User Agent (MUA) to the recipient mailbox is rarely less than 2 and is often higher.  Some hops may be TLS protected, and some may not.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.2.p.2">The same SMTP TCP endpoint can serve both TLS and non-TLS clients, with TLS negotiated via the SMTP STARTTLS command (<a href="#RFC3207">[RFC3207]</a>).  DNS MX records abstract the next-hop transport endpoint by allowing network administrators to specify a set of target servers to which SMTP traffic should be directed for a given domain.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.2.p.3">SMTP recipient addresses are not transport addresses and are security-agnostic.  Unlike the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and its corresponding secured version, HTTPS, there is no URI scheme for email addresses to designate whether communication with the SMTP server should be conducted via a cleartext or TLS-encrypted channel.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.2.p.4">A Message Transfer Agent (MTA) may need to forward a message to a particular email recipient &lt;user@example.com&gt;.  To deliver the message, the MTA needs to retrieve the MX hostnames of example.com from the DNS, and deliver the message to one of the named hosts.  Absent DNSSEC, the MX lookup is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle (MITM) and DNS cache poisoning attacks.  Active attackers can forge DNS replies with fake MX records, and can redirect email to servers of their choice.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.2.p.5">TLS clients are generally vulnerable to MITM attacks unless they verify that the server's certificate binds its public key to the hostname used by the client to resolve the server's network address in DNS.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.2.p.6">Since, without DNSSEC, MX hostnames are subject to tampering, secure verification of MX host TLS certificates is not possible without DNSSEC.  And in any case, an MITM attacker can also suppress the MX host's STARTTLS EHLO response, convincing the SMTP client that communication over TLS is unavailable.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.2.p.7">One might try to harden STARTTLS with SMTP against DNS attacks by requiring each MX host to possess a trusted certificate for the envelope recipient domain rather than the MX hostname.  Unfortunately, this is impractical, as email for many domains is handled by third parties that are not in a position to obtain certificates for all the domains they serve.  Deployment of SNI (see <a href="#RFC6066">[RFC6066]</a> Section 3.1) is no panacea, since SNI key management is operationally challenging except when the email service provider is also the domain's registrar and its certificate issuer; this is rarely the case for email.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.2.p.8">Since the recipient domain name cannot be used as the SMTP server authentication identity, and neither can the MX hostname without DNSSEC, large-scale deployment of authenticated TLS for SMTP requires that the DNS be secure.  At this time, DNSSEC is not yet widely deployed and MTA-to-MTA traffic between Internet-connected organizations is often entirely unencrypted, or uses TLS without authentication, which protects only against passive eavesdropping attacks.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.2.p.9">The exceptions are cases in which the sending MTA is explicitly configured to use TLS for mail sent to specifically selected peer domains.  In many cases this also requires configuration of appropriate subject names (or alternatively certificate content digests) to expect in the presented host certificates of MX hosts for those domains.  Such statically configured SMTP secure channels are used rarely (generally only between domains that make bilateral arrangements with their business partners).  Internet email, on the other hand, requires regularly contacting new domains for which security configurations cannot be established in advance.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.2.p.10">Note, the above does not apply to mail submission <a href="#RFC6409">[RFC6409]</a>, where an MUA is pre-configured to send its outgoing email to a fixed Message Submission Agent (MSA).  Submission servers usually offer TLS and the MUA is often configured to require TLS with its chosen MSA.  The situation changes, however, when submission servers are configured dynamically via SRV records (see <a href="#RFC6186">[RFC6186]</a> Section 6).  Applications to submission via SRV records will be discussed later in this memo.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.2.p.11">The abstraction of the SMTP transport endpoint via DNS MX records, often across organization boundaries, limits the use of public CA PKI with SMTP to a small set of sender-configured peer domains.  With little opportunity to use TLS authentication, sending MTAs are rarely configured with a comprehensive list of trusted CAs.  MX hosts that support STARTTLS often use X.509 certificates that are self-signed or issued by a private CA.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.2.p.12">This does not mean, however, that the Internet email backbone cannot benefit from TLS.  The fact that transport security is not explicitly specified in either the recipient address or the MX record means that new protocols can furnish out-of-band information to SMTP, making it possible to simultaneously discover which peer domains support secure delivery via TLS and how to verify the authenticity of the associated MX hosts.  This document defines how DANE TLSA records are used to harden SMTP STARTTLS against MITM attacks.  </p>

<h1 id="rfc.section.2"><a href="#rfc.section.2">2.</a> Hardening Opportunistic TLS</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.1">Neither email addresses nor MX hostnames (or submission SRV records) signal a requirement for either secure or cleartext transport.  Therefore, SMTP transport security is of necessity generally (that is, barring manually configured exceptions) opportunistic.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.2">This specification makes it possible for DANE TLSA records to securely signal TLS support and to publish the means by which SMTP clients can successfully authenticate legitimate SMTP servers.  This makes opportunistic TLS resistant to downgrade and MITM attacks, enabling an incremental transition of the email backbone to authenticated TLS delivery, with increased global protection as adoption increases.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.3">With opportunistic DANE TLS, traffic from SMTP clients to domains that publish "usable" DANE TLSA records in accordance with this memo is authenticated and encrypted.  Traffic from non-compliant clients or to domains that do not publish TLSA records will continue to be sent in the same manner as before, via manually configured security, (pre-DANE) opportunistic TLS or just cleartext SMTP.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.2.1"><a href="#rfc.section.2.1">2.1.</a> <a href="#dnserr" id="dnserr">DNS lookup errors and bogus responses</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.2.1.p.1">To avoid much repetition in the text below, we will pause to explain the handling of "bogus" DNSSEC query responses.  These are not necessarily the result of a malicious actor; they can, for example, occur when network packets are corrupted in transit.  One may view DNSSEC as just a stronger data integrity mechanism than the usual UDP checksum.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.1.p.2">In this light, "bogus" replies are simply lookup failures, provided we carefully define what we mean by a DNS lookup failure (setting DNSSEC validation aside for the moment).  There are two important non-failure conditions we need to highlight in addition to the obvious case of the DNS client obtaining a well-formed response with relevant resource records in the answer section: </p>
<p/>

<ol>
  <li>When a well-formed DNS response has an RCODE of "NoError" (<a href="#RFC6895">[RFC6895]</a> Section 2.3), but the answer count is zero; while the DNS client may not have obtained the data it was looking for, the response is not a DNS error condition.  The DNS client has not been left without an answer; it learns that records of the requested type do not exist. </li>
  <li>Similarly, when a well-formed DNS response has an RCODE of "NXDomain", once again the DNS client learns not only that records of the requested type do not exist, but also that the query domain does not exist.  </li>
</ol>

<p> </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.1.p.4">When the response is malformed, or has any RCODE other than "NoError" or "NXDOMAIN", the DNS lookup has failed.  Returning to DNSSEC, in many cases MTAs will delegate DNSSEC processing to a validating caching resolver running on the MTA machine, and in this configuration the resolver will not even return "bogus" replies to the MTA, rather these will generally be reported as lookup errors with a "ServFail" RCODE.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.1.p.5">We emphasize that an "insecure" DNSSEC response is not a failure, rather the target DNS zone is not signed, and DNSSEC validation is not applicable to records associated with the query domain.  Insecure results may lead to degradation of channel security, but do not stand in the way of message delivery.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.1.p.6">When the DNS client's query encounters a CNAME alias, it should generally restart the query at the target of the alias, recursively up to some configured or implementation-dependent recursion depth limit.  If at any stage of recursive CNAME expansion a query fails, the lookup of the original requested records MUST be considered to have failed.  If at any stage of recursive expansion the response is "insecure", then it and all subsequent results, and in particular the final result, MUST be considered "insecure" regardless of the validation status of the corresponding query response.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.1.p.7">If the SMTP client is performing its own DNSSEC validation, and detects a "bogus" response, it is simplest to treat this case as though the client had received a "ServFail" response from its caching resolver.  And in turn a "ServFail" error is treated in the same way as any other error condition that neither returns the requested data, nor reports its non-existence.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.1.p.8">When a DNS lookup failure (as defined above) prevents an SMTP client from determining which SMTP server or servers it should connect to, message delivery MUST be delayed.  This naturally includes, for example, the case when a "bogus" response is encountered during MX resolution.  When multiple SMTP server names are determined, but a DNS lookup failure prevents network address resolution for a given server, delivery may proceed via any remaining servers.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.1.p.9">When a particular SMTP server is selected as the delivery destination, this memo specifies a set of DNS lookups that are performed to determine the related TLSA records.  If any DNS queries used to locate TLSA records fail (be it due to "bogus" records, timeouts, malformed replies, etc.), then the SMTP client MUST treat that server as unreachable and MUST NOT deliver the message via that server.  If no servers are reachable, delivery is delayed.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.1.p.10">In what follows, we will only describe what happens when all relevant DNS queries succeed.  If any fail, the SMTP client MUST behave as described in this section.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.2.2"><a href="#rfc.section.2.2">2.2.</a> TLS discovery</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.2.2.p.1">As noted previously (<a href="#channelsec">Section 1.2</a>), opportunistic TLS with SMTP servers that advertise TLS support via STARTTLS is subject to an MITM downgrade attack.  Also some SMTP servers that are not, in fact, TLS capable, erroneously advertise STARTTLS by default and clients need to be prepared to retry plaintext delivery after STARTTLS fails.  In contrast, DNSSEC validated TLSA records are unlikely to be accidentally published for servers that do not support TLS, and thus clients can safely interpret their presence as a commitment by the server operator to implement STARTTLS.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.2.p.2">Specifically, when an SMTP client locates "secure" TLSA records for an SMTP server, the client SHOULD NOT connect to the server without negotiating a TLS-encrypted channel.  Absent "secure" (DNSSEC validated) TLSA records, the SMTP client should employ pre-DANE opportunistic TLS.  In other words, TLS encryption is required when securely signalled by the presence of DANE TLSA records, even though the server may not be authenticated when none the records are "usable".  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.2.p.3">When at least one of then TLSA records is "usable" (<a href="#RFC6698">[RFC6698]</a>, Section 4.1) the client SHOULD authenticate the server.  With "usable" TLSA records the transmission of email from client to server resists eavesdropping and tampering so long as the server's DNSSEC records are not compromised.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.2.p.4">An SMTP client may be configured to require DANE verified delivery for some destinations.  We will call such a configuration "mandatory DANE TLS".  With mandatory DANE TLS delivery proceeds only when "secure" TLSA records are used to establish an encrypted and authenticated TLS channel with the SMTP server.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.2.p.5">A note about DNAME aliases.  A query for a domain name whose ancestor domain is a DNAME alias returns the DNAME RR for the ancestor domain, along with a CNAME mapping the query domain to the corresponding sub-domain of the target domain of the DNAME alias.  Therefore, whenever we speak of CNAME aliases, we implicitly allow for the possibility that the alias in question is the result of an ancestor domain DNAME record.  Consequently, no explicit support for DNAME records is needed in SMTP software, it is sufficient to process the resulting CNAME aliases.  DNAME records only require special processing in the DNSSEC library that validates the integrity of the combined DNAME + CNAME reply.  When DNSSEC validation is handled by a local caching resolver, rather than the MTA itself, even that part of the DNAME support logic is outside the MTA.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.2.p.6">When the original next-hop destination is an address literal, rather than a DNS domain, DANE TLS does not apply.  Delivery proceeds using any relevant security policy configured by the MTA administrator.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.2.p.7">In the subsections that follow we explain how to locate the SMTP servers and the associated TLSA records for a given next-hop destination domain.  We also explain which name or names are to be used in identity checks of the SMTP server certificate.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.2.2.1"><a href="#rfc.section.2.2.1">2.2.1.</a> <a href="#mx" id="mx">MX resolution</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.2.2.1.p.1">In this section we consider next-hop domains that are subject to MX resolution and have MX records.  The TLSA records and associated base domain will be derived separately for each MX hostname used to attempt message delivery.  Clearly, if DANE TLS security is to apply to message delivery via any of the MX hosts, the MX hostnames must be obtained securely via a DNSSEC validated MX lookup.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.2.1.p.2">MX records MUST be sorted by preference; an MX hostname with a worse (numerically higher) MX preference that has TLSA records MUST NOT preempt an MX hostname with a better (numerically lower) preference that has no TLSA records.  In other words, prevention of delivery loops by obeying MX preferences MUST take precedence over channel security considerations.  Even with two equal preference MX hosts, an MTA is not obligated to choose the MX hostname that offers more security.  Domains that want secure inbound mail delivery need to ensure that all their MX hosts are configured accordingly.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.2.1.p.3">In the language of <a href="#RFC5321">[RFC5321]</a> Section 5.1, the original next-hop domain is the "initial name".  If the MX lookup of the initial name results in a CNAME alias, we replace the initial name with the resulting name and perform a new lookup with the new name.  MTAs typically support recursion in CNAME expansion, so this replacement is performed repeatedly until the ultimate non-CNAME domain is found.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.2.1.p.4">If, the final MX RRset is "insecure" (see <a href="#dnserr">Section 2.1</a>), DANE TLS does not apply, and delivery proceeds via pre-DANE opportunistic TLS.  Otherwise, the MX RRset is "secure", and each MX hostname used to attempt message delivery is treated as an independent non-MX destination for opportunistic DANE TLS as described in <a href="#non-mx">Section 2.2.2</a>.  When for a given MX hostname no TLSA records are found, or only "insecure" TLSA records are found, DANE TLSA is not applicable with the MX hostname in question and delivery proceeds as with pre-DANE opportunistic TLS.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.2.2.2"><a href="#rfc.section.2.2.2">2.2.2.</a> <a href="#non-mx" id="non-mx">Non-MX destinations</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.2.2.2.p.1">This section describes the algorithm used to locate the TLSA records and associated TLSA base domain for an input domain not subject to MX resolution.  Such domains include: </p>
<p/>

<ul>
  <li>Each MX hostname used in a message delivery attempt for an original next-hop destination domain subject to MX resolution.  Note, MTAs are not obligated to support CNAME expansion of MX hostnames. </li>
  <li>Any administrator configured relay hostname, not subject to MX resolution, configured by the MTA administrator to handle some or all mail. </li>
  <li>A next-hop destination domain subject to MX resolution that has no MX records.  In this case the domain's name is implicitly the hostname of its sole SMTP server. </li>
</ul>

<p> </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.2.2.p.3">DNS queries with type TLSA are mishandled by some load balancing nameservers that serve the MX hostnames of large email providers.  The DNS zones served by these nameservers are not signed and contain no TLSA records, but queries for TLSA records fail, rather than returning the non-existence of the requested TLSA records.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.2.2.p.4">To avoid problems delivering mail to domains whose SMTP servers are served by the problem nameservers the SMTP client MUST perform any A and/or AAAA queries for the destination before attempting to locate the associated TLSA records.  This lookup is needed in any case to determine whether the destination domain is reachable and the DNSSEC validation status of each stage of the chain of CNAME queries required to reach the final result.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.2.2.p.5">If no address records are found, the destination is unreachable.  If address records are found, but the DNSSEC validation status of the first query response is "insecure" (there may be additional queries if the initial response is a CNAME alias), the SMTP client SHOULD NOT proceed to search for any associated TLSA records.  With the problem domains, TLSA queries will lead to DNS lookup errors and cause messages to be consistently delayed and ultimately returned to the sender.  We don't expect to find any "secure" TLSA records associated with a TLSA base domain that lies in an unsigned DNS zone.  Therefore, skipping TLSA lookups in this case will also reduce latency with no detrimental impact on security.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.2.2.p.6">When CNAME expansion is applicable, in the language of <a href="#RFC5321">[RFC5321]</a> Section 5.1, the input domain is the "initial name".  If the A and/or AAAA lookup of the initial name yields a CNAME, we replace it with the resulting name as if it were the initial name and perform a lookup again using the new name.

<p id="rfc.section.2.2.3.p.3">If the ultimate response is a "secure" TLSA RRset (see <a href="#dnserr">Section 2.1</a>) then the candidate TLSA domain will be the actual TLSA domain and the TLSA RRset will constitute the TLSA records for the destination.

<p id="rfc.section.2.2.3.p.4">For SMTP, the destination TCP port is typically 25, but this may be different with custom routes specified by the MTA administrator or when an MUA connects to a submission server on port 587.  The SMTP client MUST use the appropriate number in the "_&lt;port&gt;" prefix in place of "_25".  If, for example, the candidate base domain is "mail.example.com", and the SMTP connection is to port 25, the TLSA RRset is obtained via a DNSSEC query of the form: </p>

Other than extracting the relevant certificate elements for comparison, no other use is made of the certificate content.  Authentication via certificate usage "3" TLSA records involves no certificate authority signature checks.  It also involves no server name checks, and thus does not impose any new requirements on the names contained in the server certificate (SNI is not required when the TLSA record matches server's default certificate).  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.3.1.1.p.3">Two TLSA records will need to be published before updating a server's public key, one matching the currently deployed key and the other matching the new key scheduled to replace it.  Once sufficient time has elapsed for all DNS caches to expire the previous TLSA RRset, which contains only the old key, the server may be reconfigured to use the new private key and associated public key certificate.

Finally, the "matching type" is 1, which indicates that the "associated data" is the SHA2-256 digest of the server's public key.  Since all DANE implementations are required to support SHA2-256, this record works for all clients and need not change across certificate renewals with the same key.  </p>

The TLSA RRs for each service issued by the same TA may then be CNAMEs to a common TLSA RRset that matches the TA.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.3.1.2.p.2">SMTP servers that rely on certificate usage "2" TLSA records for TLS authentication MUST include the TA certificate as part of the certificate chain presented in the TLS handshake even when it is a self-signed root certificate.

<p id="rfc.section.2.3.2.p.1">When at least one usable "secure" TLSA record is found, the SMTP client SHOULD use TLSA records to authenticate the SMTP server.  Messages SHOULD not be delivered via the SMTP server if authentication fails, otherwise the SMTP client is vulnerable to MITM attacks.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.3.2.p.2">To match a server via a TLSA record with certificate usage "2", the client MUST perform name checks to ensure that it has reached the correct server.  In all cases the SMTP client MUST accept the TLSA base domain as a valid DNS name in the server certificate.  </p>

  <dt>MX:</dt>
  <dd style="margin-left: 8">If the TLSA base domain was obtained indirectly via an MX lookup (it is the possibly CNAME-expanded name of an MX host), then the original next-hop domain used in the MX lookup MUST be accepted in the peer certificate.  The CNAME-expanded original next-hop domain MUST also be accepted if different from the initial query name. </dd>
  <dt>Non-MX:</dt>
  <dd style="margin-left: 8">If MX records were not used and the TLSA base domain is the CNAME-expanded original next-hop domain, then the original next-hop domain MUST also be accepted.  </dd>
</dl>

<p> </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.3.2.p.3">Accepting certificates with the original next-hop domain in addition to the MX hostname allows a domain with multiple MX hostnames to field a single certificate bearing the email domain name across all the MX hosts.  This also aids inter-operability with pre-DANE SMTP clients that are configured to look for the email domain name in server certificates.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.3.2.p.4">The SMTP client MUST NOT perform certificate usage name checks with certificate usage "3", since with usage "3" the server is authenticated directly by matching the TLSA RRset to its certificate or public key without resort to any issuing authority.  The certificate content is ignored except in so far as it is used to match the certificate or public key (ASN.1 DER encoding or its digest) with the TLSA RRset.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.3.2.p.5">To ensure that the server sends the right certificate chain, the SMTP client MUST send the TLS SNI extension containing the TLSA base domain.  This precludes the use of SSLv2-compatible SSL HELLO by the SMTP client.  The minimum SSL/TLS version for SMTP clients performing DANE authentication is SSLv3.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.3.2.p.6">Each SMTP server MUST present a certificate chain (see <a href="#RFC5246">[RFC5246]</a> Section 7.4.2) that matches at least one of the TLSA records.  The server MAY rely on SNI to determine which certificate chain to present to the client.  Clients that don't send SNI information may not see the expected certificate chain.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.3.2.p.7">If the server's TLSA RRset includes records with a matching type indicating a digest record (i.e., a value other than "0"), the SHA2-256 digest of any object SHOULD be provided along with any other digest published, since some SMTP clients may support only SHA2-256.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.3.2.p.8">If the server's TLSA records match the server's default certificate chain, the server need not support SNI.  In either case, the server need not include the extension in its TLS HELLO, simply returning a matching certificate chain is sufficient.  Servers MUST NOT enforce the use of SNI by clients, if the client sends no SNI extension, or sends an SNI extension for an unsupported domain the server MUST simply use its default certificate chain.  The client may be using unauthenticated opportunistic TLS and may not expect any particular certificate from the server.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.3.2.p.9">The SMTP client MAY include anonymous TLS cipher suites in its SSL HELLO.  MX hosts that receive email from the Internet MUST interoperate with opportunistic TLS SMTP clients.  If they advertise support for STARTTLS in their SMTP EHLO response, they MUST NOT fail to complete the TLS handshake merely because the SMTP client offered some cipher suites that do not provide for server authentication.  While SMTP server operators are under no obligation to enable anonymous cipher suites, no security is gained by sending certificates clients are willing to ignore.  Indeed support for anonymous cipher suites in the server makes audit trails more informative.  Log entries that record connections that employed an anonymous cipher suite record the fact that the clients did not care to authenticate the server.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.2.3.3"><a href="#rfc.section.2.3.3">2.3.3.</a> <a href="#agility" id="agility">Digest algorithm agility</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.2.3.3.p.1">While <a href="#RFC6698">[RFC6698]</a> specifies multiple digest algorithms, it does not specify a protocol by which the SMTP client and TLSA record publisher can agree on the strongest shared algorithm.  Such a protocol would allow the client and server to avoid exposure to any deprecated weaker algorithms that are published for compatibilty with less capable clients, but should if possible be ignored.  We specify such a protocol below.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.3.3.p.2">Suppose that a DANE TLS client authenticating a TLS server considers digest algorithm X stronger than digest algorithm Y.  Suppose further that a server's TLSA RRset contains some records with X as the digest algorithm.  Finally, suppose that for every raw public key or certificate object that is included in the server's TLSA RRset in digest form, whenever that object appears with algorithm Y with some usage and selector it also appears with algorithm X with the same usage and selector.  In that case our client can safely ignore TLSA records with the weaker algorithm Y, because it suffices to check the records with the stronger algorithm X.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.3.3.p.3">To achieve digest algorithm agility we mandate that all published TLSA RRsets conform to the above assumptions.  Then, for each combination of usage and selector, SMTP clients can simply ignore all digest records except those that employ the strongest digest algorithm.  The ordering of digest algorithms by strength is not specified in advance, it is entirely up to the SMTP client.  SMTP client implementations are encouranged to make the digest algorithm preference order configurable.  Only the future will tell which algorithms might be weakened by new attacks and when.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.3.3.p.4">Note, TLSA records with a matching type of "0", that publish the full value of a certificate or public key object, play no role in digest algorithm agility.  They neither trump the processing of records that employ digests, nor are they ignored in the presence of any records with a digest (i.e. non-zero) matching type.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.3.3.p.5">Server operators MUST ensure that for any given usage and selector, each object (certificate or public key), for which a digest association exists in the TLSA RRset, is published with the SAME SET of digest algorithms as all other objects that published with that usage and selector.  In other words, for each usage and selector, the records with non-zero matching types will correspond to on a cross-product of a set of underlying objects and a fixed set of digest algorithms that apply uniformly to all the objects.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.3.3.p.6">SMTP clients SHOULD use digest algorithm agility when processing the DANE TLSA records of an SMTP server.  Algorithm agility is to be applied after first discarding any unusable or malformed records (unsupported digest algorithm, or incorrect digest length).  Thus, for each usage and selector, the client SHOULD process only any usable records with a matching type of "0" and the usable records whose digest algorithm is believed to be the strongest among usable records with the given usage and selector.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.3.3.p.7">The main impact of this requirement is on key rotation, when the TLSA RRset is pre-populated with digests of new certificates or public keys, before these replace or augment their predecessors.  Were the newly introduced RRs to include previously unused digest algorithms, clients that employ this protocol could potentially ignore all the digests corresponding to the current keys or certificates, causing connectivity issues until the new keys or certificates are deployed.  Similarly, publishing new records with fewer digests could cause problems for clients using cached TLSA RRsets that list both the old and new objects once the new keys are deployed.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.3.3.p.8">To avoid problems, server operators SHOULD apply the following strategy: </p>

<ul>
  <li>When changing the set of objects published via the TLSA RRset (e.g. during key rotation), DO NOT change the set of digest algorithms used, change just the list of objects. </li>
  <li>When changing the set of digest algorithms, change only the set of algorithms, and generate a new RRset in which all the current objects are re-published with the new set of digest algorithms. </li>
</ul>

<p> </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.3.3.p.9">The client-side of this "digest algorithm agility" protocol is enabled by default in the first DANE for SMTP implementation.  For key rotation to work non-disruptively server operators MUST ensure that their TLSA records conform with the above specification.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.3"><a href="#rfc.section.3">3.</a> Opportunistic TLS for Submission</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.1">Prior to <a href="#RFC6409">[RFC6409]</a>, the SMTP submission protocol was a poster-child for PKIX TLS.  The MUA typically connects to one or a few submission servers explicitly configured by the user.  There is no indirection via insecure MX records, and unlike web browsers, there is no need to authenticate a large set of TLS servers.  Once TLS is enabled for the desired submission server or servers, provided the server certificate is correctly maintained, the MUA is able to reliably use TLS to authenticate the submission server.  The MUA's list of trusted CAs need not be comprehensive, it suffices to trust just the CAs that issue the certificates of the particular submission servers.  </p>
<p><a href="#RFC6186">[RFC6186]</a> aims to simplify the configuration of the MUA submission service by dynamically deriving the submission service from the user's email address.  This is done via SRV records, but at the cost of introducing many of the same TLS security problems faced by MTA to MTA SMTP.  The suggestion to prompt the user when the SRV record domain is different from the email domain is not a robust solution.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.3">The protocol defined in this memo can also be used to secure submission service discovery.  If the email domain is DNSSEC signed, the SRV records are "secure" and the SRV host publishes secure TLSA records for submission, then the MUA can safely auto-configure to authenticate the submission server via DANE.  When DANE TLSA records are not available, the client SHOULD fall back to legacy behavior (this may involve prompting the user to accept the resulting server and perhaps "pin" its certificate).  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.4">Specifically, MUAs that dynamically determine the submission server via SRV records SHOULD support DNSSEC and DANE TLSA records.  They SHOULD use TLSA records to authenticate the server.  The processing of usage 2 and 3 TLSA associations by an MUA is the same as by an MTA, with SRV records taking the place of MX records.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.5">Just as with MX service on port 25, SMTP submission servers SHOULD NOT publish usage 0 or 1 TLSA associations, and MUAs that support DANE TLSA are not expected to trust a full list of public CAs.  Server certificate subjectAltNames should include at least the server name.  When the server administrator is able to obtain a certificate for the email domain, the server certificate should also include the email domain name.  MUAs that are not able to support DNSSEC may then be able to authenticate the server domain.  If it is practical to field additional certificates for hosted domains, SNI may be used by the server to select the appropriate domain's certificate.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.4"><a href="#rfc.section.4">4.</a> Mandatory TLS Security</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.1">An MTA implementing this protocol may require a stronger security assurance when sending email to selected destinations to which the sending organization sends sensitive email and may have regulatory obligations to protect its content.  This protocol is not in conflict with such a requirement, and in fact can often simplify authenticated delivery to such destinations.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.2">Specifically, with domains that publish DANE TLSA records for their MX hostnames a sending MTA can be configured to use the receiving domains's DANE TLSA records to authenticate the corresponding MX hostnames.  Authentication via DANE TLSA records is easier to manage, as changes in the receiver's expected certificate properties are made on the receiver end.  With mandatory DANE TLS, when no usable TLSA records are found, message delivery is delayed.  Thus mail is only sent when an authenticated TLS channel is established to the remote SMTP server.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.3">Administrators of mail servers that employ mandatory DANE TLS, need to carefully monitor their mail logs and queues.  If a partner domain unwittingly misconfigures their TLSA records, disables DNSSEC, or misconfigures SMTP server certificate chains, mail will be delayed.  </p>

<h1 id="rfc.section.6.1"><a href="#rfc.section.6.1">6.1.</a> <a href="#opclients" id="opclients">Client Operational Considerations</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.6.1.p.1">SMTP clients may deploy opportunistic DANE TLS incrementally by enabling it only for selected sites, or may occasionally need to disable opportunistic DANE TLS for peers that fail to interoperate due to misconfiguration or software defects on either end.  Unless local policy specifies that opportunistic DANE TLS is not to be used for a particular destination, client MUST NOT deliver mail via a server whose certificate chain fails to match at least one TLSA record when usable TLSA records are available.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.1.p.2">SMTP clients employing opportunistic DANE TLS and TLSA record publishers for SMTP servers need to follow the guidance outlined in <a href="#I-D.ietf-dane-ops">[I-D.ietf-dane-ops]</a>'s "Certificate Name Check Conventions", "Service Provider and TLSA Publisher Synchronization" and "TLSA Base Domain and CNAMEs" sections.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.6.2"><a href="#rfc.section.6.2">6.2.</a> <a href="#oppublishers" id="oppublishers">Publisher Operational Considerations</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.6.2.p.1">SMTP servers that publish certificate usage 2 (trust-anchor) associations MUST include the TA certificate in their TLS server certificate chain even when that TA certificate is a self-signed root certificate.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.2.p.2">TLSA Publishers MUST follow the digest agility guidelines in <a href="#agility">Section 2.3.3</a> and make sure that all objects published in digest form for a particular usage and selector are published with the same set of digest algorithms.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.2.p.3">TLSA Publishers should follow the TLSA publication size guidance found in <a href="#I-D.ietf-dane-ops">[I-D.ietf-dane-ops]</a> about "DANE DNS Record Size Guidelines".  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.7"><a href="#rfc.section.7">7.</a> <a href="#Security" id="Security">Security Considerations</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.7.p.1">This protocol leverages DANE TLSA records to implement MITM resistant opportunistic channel security for SMTP.  For destination domains that sign their MX records and publish signed TLSA records for their MX hostnames, this protocol allows sending MTAs (and perhaps dynamically configured MUAs) to securely discover both the availability of TLS and how to authenticate the destination.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.p.2">This protocol does not aim to secure all SMTP traffic, as that is not practical until DNSSEC and DANE adoption are universal.  The incremental deployment provided by following this specification is a best possible path for securing SMTP.  This protocol coexists and interoperates with the existing insecure Internet email backbone.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.p.3">The protocol does not preclude existing non-opportunistic SMTP TLS security arrangements, which can continue to be used as before via manual configuration with negotiated out-of-band key and TLS configuration exchanges.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.p.4">Opportunistic SMTP TLS depends critically on DNSSEC for downgrade resistance and secure resolution of the destination name.  If DNSSEC is compromised, it is not possible to fall back on the public CA PKI to prevent MITM attacks.  A successful breach of DNSSEC enables the attacker to publish TLSA usage 3 certificate associations, and thereby bypass any security benefit the legitimate domain owner might hope to gain by publishing usage 0 or 1 TLSA RRs.  Given the lack of public CA PKI support in existing MTA deployments, avoiding certificate usages 0 and 1 simplifies implementationa and deployment with no adverse security consequences.  </p>
